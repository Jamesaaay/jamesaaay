### Who am I

I'm James O'Neill, a software developer from Ireland. Always coming up with new ideas and then procrastinating when implementing them. With over 4 years in the insurance software implementation industry using a wide variety of technology including Java and AWS. A forward thinking indvidual who craves for new knowledge each day and a great team-worker who keeps the mood in the team high while always thinking about the end goal. I aim to branch out from this area to tackle more diverse and fufiling projects within the app development and gaming industries.
